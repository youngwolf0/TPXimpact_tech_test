# This theme is marked as @internal. It is intended to evolve and change over
# minor releases.
# Change record https://www.drupal.org/node/2673014.
# As the UI of Drupal improves between minor versions, the mark up and assets
# in the tech_test_theme theme will change. The tech_test_theme theme is not backwards
# compatible. If you wish to modify the output or assets of tech_test_theme you can:
# 1. Copy the whole of tech_test_theme and rename it as your own theme. You will need to
# manually manage your own updates if you want to stay up to date with tech_test_theme's
# bug fixes and feature support.
#
# 2. Sub-theme tech_test_theme. This is only recommended if you want to make minor
# tweaks and understand that tech_test_theme could break your modifications as it
# changes.
